# Gwent-DeckBuilder
Gwent: The Witcher Card Game - Deck-builder and Card Database

## Description
This full-stack application is based of Gwent, which is a CCG (Collectible Card Game) that was originally a game within a game. The first origins of Gwent came from the famous video game series 'The Witcher'. Within The Witcher - Gwent was a card game that you could play (as a player) against opponents (NPCs). This game got so popular, that the devs for The Witcher decided to create a standalone version of this game. My application will be a database that stores Gwents current card pool, and allows the user to create a deck based off of the current card pool.
